This is a self-contained ATLAS AnalysisBase image with xAODAnaHelpers. Your
.bashrc should already execute the necessary scripts to set up the analysis
base release as well as xAODAnaHelpers. View our online documentation here:

      https://ucatlas.github.io/xAODAnaHelpers/

To set up xAODAnaHelpers + the analysis release of the image, please execute:

      source /home/atlas/xAODAnaHelpers_setup.sh

To set up *only* the analysis release of the image, please execute:

      source /home/atlas/release_setup.sh
