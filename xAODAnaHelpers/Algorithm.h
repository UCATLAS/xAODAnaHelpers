            This is used by all algorithms within |xAH|.

            .. note:: The expectation is that the user does not directly use this class but rather inherits from it.

            The main goal of this algorithm class is to standardize how everyone defines an algorithm that plugs into |xAH|. A series of common utilities are provided such as :cpp:member:`~xAH::Algorithm::m_className` which defines the class name so we can manage a registry :cpp:member:`~xAH::Algorithm::m_instanceRegistry` to keep |xAH| as flexible as possible to our users.

            We expect the user to create a new algorithm, such as a selector for jets::

                class JetSelector : public xAH::Algorithm
                {
                    // ...
                };

            The above example is taken from our implementation in :cpp:class:`JetSelector`. Just remember that when you write your initializer, you will be expected to do something like::

                // this is needed to distribute the algorithm to the workers
                ClassImp(JetSelector)


                JetSelector :: JetSelector () :
                    Algorithm("JetSelector"),
                    ...
                {
                    // ...
                }

            which this class will automatically register all instances of for you. Each instance can have a different name :cpp:member:`~xAH::Algorithm::m_name` but will have the same :cpp:member:`~xAH::Algorithm::m_className` so we can track how many references have been made. This is useful for selectors to deal with cutflows, but can be useful for other algorithms that need to know how many times they've been instantiated in a single job.
